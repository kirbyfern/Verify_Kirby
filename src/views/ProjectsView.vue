This controller is an industrial computer equipped with a microprocessor that runs a proprietary real-time operating system. Among its various functions, the operating system offers a primary client interface, allowing external devices to remotely interact with the robot. The interface communicates with its clients via messages using hexadecimal strings that represent binary data, encoding robot state information as specified in their documentation. I used this specification to design a client library that receives these messages, parses strings, then deserializes their content before writing them to files. The client enables end-users to enhance their real-time robot applicationâ€™s ability to support robot state monitoring.",

For each point, the Euclidean distance is calculated with all other points to determine its closest neighbor. The point is then moved one step closer to that neighbor. To handle the large number of computations required, points can be partitioned into groups and assigned threads to process them in parallel. In this experiment, WGSL was used to leverage the power of GPUs and accommodate nearly 18x more data points at 60 FPS than the web worker method. The experiment highlights the benefits and limitations of each parallel computing method and provides insights into the best approach to use for different types of problems.",

After performing the necessary file system actions based on the request, the server sent an appropriate response message back to the client.
